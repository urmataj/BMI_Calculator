A BMI Calculator application using Java and JavaFX that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides information on their BMI status according to the Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health guidelines. It contains three files:

# (Main) Application class
The class responsible for launching the application and loading your FXML.

# FXML file

# Controller class
